      "    \"abstract\": \"Ultrasonic bonding of aluminum wire is a technique widely used for joining wire to substrates and integrated circuit chips. Despite numerous metallurgical studies of wire bonding, the basic mechanism of bonding is still not well understood due to the limited resolution of the experimental techniques used to study bond interfaces. In this study, transmission electron microscopy is used to examine ultrasonic bonding of aluminum wire to various metal substrates. A special technique for preparing cross-section TEM specimens is described which involves embedding the samples in epoxy, dimpling, and electropolishing. The materials systems examined are A1 wire bonded to A1 foil, and A1 wire bonded to foil onto which copper or gold was evaporated. of the bond interface in the TEM reveals that in some areas, the surface oxides and contaminants were dispersed, allowing the bare metals to contact, whereas in other nearby areas, the bond interface is filled with debris. The debris could be oxides, surface contaminants or sheared metal particles. It also appears that the debris is dispersed to low-lying regions between asperities. In studies of the Al/Au/Al and Al/Cu/Al interfaces, microchemical analysis showed no evidence for diffusion or melting along the interface. Therefore, it is concluded that ultrasonic wire bonding does not involve significant heating along the bonding interface. However, it is shown that dynamic annealing of aluminum wire can occur during bonding. compared with the previously proposed theories on the mechanism of bonding in ultrasonic welding.The experimental results are\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Free air ball (FAB) and bonded strength were performed on an Ag-10Au-3.6Pd alloy bonding wire (diameter of 0.025 mm) for different electronic flame-off (EFO) currents, times and bonding parameters. The effects of the EFO and bonding parameters on the characteristics of the FAB as well as the bonded strength were investigated using scanning electron microscopy. The results showed that, for a constant EFO time, the FAB of the Ag-10Au-3.6Pd alloy bonding wire transitioned from a pointed defined ball to an oval one, then to a perfectly shaped one, and finally to a golf ball with an increase in the EFO current. On the other hand, when the EFO current was constant and the EFO time was increased, the FAB changed from a small ball to a perfect one, then to a large one, and finally to a golf ball. The FAB exhibited the optimal geometry at an EFO current of 0.030 A and EFO time of 0.8 ms. Further, in the case of the Ag-10Au-3.6Pd alloy bonding wire, for an EFO current of 0.030 A, the FAB diameter exhibited a nonlinear relationship with the EFO time, which could be expressed by a quadratic function. Finally, the bonded strength decreased when the bonding power and force were excessively high, causing the ball bond to overflow. This led to the formation of neck cracks and decrease in the bonded strength. On the other hand, the bonded strength was insufficiently when the bonding power and force were small. The bonded strength was of the desired level when the bonding power and force were 70 mW and 0.60 N (for the ball bonded) and 95 mW and 0.85 N (for the wedge bonded), respectively.\",\n",

The results showed that in the as-bonded condition, no IMC formed between the Agalloy wire and the gold bond pad and that the interfacial reaction mechanism was diffusional solid solution reaction. After 168 hours of thermal aging at 200\\u00b0C, it was found that adding Pd to the Agalloy wire could improve the mechanical properties of the wire, and the bonding strength between the Ag-alloy wires and gold bond pad showed an increasing trend. It was speculated that increasing the thermal aging period allowed sufficient time for the diffusion reaction between the silver alloy and gold bond pad. The gold ball residual area difference indicated that adding Pd to Agalloy wire was more helpful than adding Au for boosting BST strength in the as-bonded condition, while adding Au to ternary Ag-alloy wire helped the bonding strength in terms of thermal stability. BST and WPT test specifications are suggested for Agalloy wire joints in LED packaging products based on tests of the critical quality parameters of Cpk\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"In Microwave module, wire bonding is usually gold wedge bonding. The reliability of wedge bonding mainly depends on the surface characteristics of joint. The contamination on bond pads may result in low strength and poor strength uniformity. Therefore, contaminants must be removed from the bonding area before wedge bonding. In the present study, the effects of plasma cleaning on the reliability of wedge bonding are investigated. The cleaning methods of different process parameters were studied, and the appropriate process parameters were found. Plasma cleaning was performed on different substrates and chips and compared with those before plasma cleaning. The influence of plasma cleaning on bond contact quality has been examined by pull force measurements, which is an established test method in semiconductor packaging industry for evaluating the quality of wire bonds. From the experimental data, it is observed that the plasma cleaning with proper parameter tuning can improve the contact angle characteristics and the reliability of wire bonding, and the wire bonding strength after plasma cleaning meets microwave hybrid integrated circuit requirements.

      "    \"abstract\": \"As a result of increasing gold (Au) price, the use of copper (Cu) bonding wire has gained popularity for mass production. The different properties in hardness, oxidation and electro chemical potential between Au and Cu have a significant impact on the wire bonding process and reliability. This paper focuses on the oxidation and corrosion of Aul AI and Cui AI ball bond for the wire bonding processes and their bond reliability in pressure cooker test (PCT) and halides environment. A design of experiment was conducted to optimize the wire bonding process prior to subjecting the bonded samples to oxidation and corrosion studies. It is noted that a higher ultrasonic energy is necessary for Cu wire bonding. This is likely due to higher energy necessary to break the oxides of copper and aluminum to result in formation of bonds between the wire and the bonding pads. In PCT analysis, the Au ball shear test results remained stable while the Cu ball shear test results improved with soaking. ' CuO blisters are found on the surface of the Cu with corrosion apparent on the circumference of the Cu ball. The corrosion resulted in delamination between Al and Cu and generated undesired interface failure modes. A significant drop in stitch pull strength with large results deviation was observed for Cu wire bonding due to oxidation and stress resulting in cracks of the stitch. In halide environment, an increase in failure rate was observed for Cui AI pad. This is a result of galvanic corrosion due to the very limited intermetallic formation beneath the Cu ball which allowed electrolyte to seep in to initiate galvanic corrosion. This paper provides an insight to the failure mechanisms due to oxidation and corrosion which can weaken the Cui Al bond as compared to Au.\",\n",

Alumina, encapsulated within the AueAl intermetallic compounds (IMCs), migrates towards the Au ball during annealing, with Au diffusion into the Al pad. The sequence of AueAl IMC phase development during annealing was investigated. Initially, Au 8 Al 3 appears as a third phase between the Au 4 Al and AuAl 2 layers that form during bonding, and gradually becomes the dominant compound. Both AuAl 2 and Au 8 Al 3 are transformed into the Au-rich alloyAu 4 Al when Al is completely consumed, and this is the terminal product.\",\n",

The causes are in high fragility and low conductivity of some Au-Al system intermetallic phases. However, gold wire bonds to aluminum bond pads continue to be activity used. The reliability of these bonds depends on many factors. Introduction of other materials in Au-Al system, mounting process parameters, type of mounting tool and structure of the formed bonds are some of these factors. This article considers effects of aluminum pads structure on gold wire bonding reliability. Two types of pads were studied in this paper. It is pad with 1,5-2,5 um aluminum thick and pad with 5-10 um aluminum thick. As shown the results pads with 5-10 um thick allow to achieve greater reliability compared to pads with 1,5-2,5 um thick. As a result, it was found that under equal conditions the bonds on pads with greater thickness show acceptable mechanical strength (9.5 centinewton in pull test), while the bonds with thinner pads are destroyed.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Electromigration (EM) reliability and failure analysis of Cu wire and Au wire bonding processes on Al substrates after molding were investigated and compared systematically. According to the resistance as a function of EM time trend, there were four stages during the EM test for wire bonding that can tentatively be referred to as the fluctuating resistance stage, stable resistance stage, rapidly increasing resistance stage and quick failure stage of the sample. When the applied current was 1.8 A on a wire with a diameter of 20 \\u03bcm (at a current density of 5.7 \\u00d7 10 5 A/cm 2 ), the lifetimes of the Cu wire and Au wire bonding processes were 1032 h and 119 h, respectively, according to Weibull analyses. Two kinds of failure modes were observed: wire fracture and first bond fracture. Almost 90% of the failed samples belonged to wire fracture category. After the EM test, the thickness of intermetallic compounds (IMCs) at the anode interface was similar to that at the cathode interface for both the Cu wire and Au wire bonding cases, which means that the normal polarity effect during electromigration did not occur here. However, the thickness of the IMCs at the Au/Al bonding interface was thicker than that at the Cu/ Al interface for both the aged and EM samples. Voids and cracks were observed within the Au wire-bonding interface. It is suspected that the Cu wire bonding process had a slower thermal diffusion and smaller EM flux than those of the Au wire bonding process. Due to a decrease in vacancy flux within the Cu wire bonding region, the cracks were also suppressed, which greatly extended the lifetime of the Cu wire bonds.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"As a result of increasing gold (Au) price, the use of copper (Cu) bonding wire has gained popularity for mass production. The different properties in hardness, oxidation and electro chemical potential between Au and Cu have a significant impact on the wire bonding process and reliability. This paper focuses on the oxidation and corrosion of Aul AI and Cui AI ball bond for the wire bonding processes and their bond reliability in pressure cooker test (PCT) and halides environment. A design of experiment was conducted to optimize the wire bonding process prior to subjecting the bonded samples to oxidation and corrosion studies. It is noted that a higher ultrasonic energy is necessary for Cu wire bonding. This is likely due to higher energy necessary to break the oxides of copper and aluminum to result in formation of bonds between the wire and the bonding pads. In PCT analysis, the Au ball shear test results remained stable while the Cu ball shear test results improved with soaking. ' CuO blisters are found on the surface of the Cu with corrosion apparent on the circumference of the Cu ball. The corrosion resulted in delamination between Al and Cu and generated undesired interface failure modes. A significant drop in stitch pull strength with large results deviation was observed for Cu wire bonding due to oxidation and stress resulting in cracks of the stitch. In halide environment, an increase in failure rate was observed for Cui AI pad. This is a result of galvanic corrosion due to the very limited intermetallic formation beneath the Cu ball which allowed electrolyte to seep in to initiate galvanic corrosion. This paper provides an insight to the failure mechanisms due to oxidation and corrosion which can weaken the Cui Al bond as compared to Au.\",\n",

The successful transition from gold (Au) to copper (Cu) in wire-bonding introduces corrosion related reliability concerns to wire-bonded devices in integrated circuit (IC) packaging. This report studies the effect of bimetallic contact, Cu wire vs. aluminum (Al) bond pad, on the corrosion failure of Al bond pads when exposed to low ppm levels of chloride (Cl -) contamination. Real time corrosion screening was carried out on simulating Cu/Al micro patterns for time-dependent observation of corrosion progression in 5-20 ppm Cl -solutions at pH 5. Al in Cu/Al bimetallic couple corroded at accelerated rate compared to Al without bimetallic contact. Cathodic hydrogen evolution was found to be the key factor driving this aggressive Al bond pad corrosion under the influence of the peripheral Cu/Al bimetallic contact in acidic chloride solution. Chemically modifying the surface of Cu wires to prevent this H 2 evolution reaction resulted in the inhibition of Al bond pad corrosion.\",\n",

The flash-Au film increases the resistance to chlorination and sulfidation of the silver (Ag) alloy wire, which is susceptible to deterioration in a chlorine-and sulfur-rich environment. In the chlorination test, the mechanical properties of the AAPA wire were better than those of the APA wire. Chloride ions corrode the wire along grain boundaries, resulting in a change from ductile fracture to brittle fracture in the tensile test. Chloride ions preferentially corroded the aluminum (Al) pad, greatly decreasing the reliability of the ball bond. The wedge bond did not fail due to the use of Au pad. In the sulfidation test, the average diameter of the wire increased with increasing sulfidation time. After sulfidation, the electrical conductivity decreased due to the thickening of Ag 2 S, whose resistance is high, and a decrease in the effective channel of the electric current. In addition, the formation of Ag 2 S caused a consumption of Ag atoms in the Ag wire, and thus formed voids at the interface between the sulfide layer and the Ag wire. The fracture of the sulfided ball bond was located in the heat-affected zone after the tensile test. The results show that the AAPA wire has better resistance in chlorination and sulfidation environment.\",\n",

Recently, needs for replacing Au wire with Cu wire is increasing also automotive industry where electronic devices need to survive harsher environment for a much longer period of time as compared with consumer product. Accordingly, a research effort for understanding product failure mechanism and reliability testing for the Cu wire bond is more important than ever. In this study, post-bonding heating process was induced after Cu wire bonding as a new approach to understand its effect on bond reliability and further understanding of Cu bond failure mechanism.

      "    \"abstract\": \"Manufacturing of electronic assemblies using printed circuit boards (PCBs) with electroless nickel/immersion gold (ENIG) surface finishes requires front-end PCB evaluation that will guarantee that good quality product enters the assembly line. The most common is an IPC-4552 mandated plating thicknesses verification of 3-6\\u00b5m and a minimum of 0.05\\u00b5m for nickel and gold, respectively. Coupled with visual examination, this verification method suffices for general PCB acceptance but may not be robust enough in cases where ENIG plating in PCBs is compromised. That poses challenges in the manufacturing environment, where resulting latent defects are detected in downstream processes but not at upfront incoming inspection. Manifestation of such latent anomaly was observed in the form of ENIG pad discoloration with variations from yellow, red or grey discolored surfaces to a more pronounced plating degradation, such as corrosive pitting. The launched failure analysis involved evaluation of manufacturing processes suspected to contribute to the cause of the condition. Effects of thermal processes, cleaning methods, soldering, parylene deposition and factory cleanliness were examined thoroughly. Concurrently, metallurgical analysis of ENIG pads was performed, where samples were subjected to scanning electron microscopic/energy dispersive xray spectroscopic (SEM/EDX) cross section analysis, Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) and gold (Au) and electroless nickel (Ni) surface examination. The resulting analysis revealed a highly porous electroless nickel coating with deep crevasses and fissures penetrating down to the base copper (Cu) layer. These open nickel boundaries were attributed to the corrosive environment within ENIG plating, which resulted in the pad surface discoloration. The root cause of ENIG pad discoloration and pitting was traced back to poor ENIG line process controls. Subsequent introduction of a nickel controller into the ENIG line were the implemented countermeasures. To mitigate the effects of discoloration at the electronic assembly level, a tinning process was implemented to prevent nickel plating oxidation and to ensure that good wettability for reliable solder joints was maintained.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Wire bond is the most common inter-connection method used to connect microchips to the terminals of a chip package. Wire bond reliability is vital to the performance of packaging device. The understanding of contamination sources and their impacts on wire bond reliability is important to prevent the potential risks. In this study, gold (Au) and copper (Cu) wires were boned to aluminum (Al) bond pad. Chlorine (Cl) and sulfur (S) contaminations were purposely introduced to wire, epoxy molding compound (EMC) and bond pad. Reliability tests bHAST (biased highly accelerated stress test) and HTS (high temperature storage test) were conducted. The results showed that Cl played a significant role on wire bond reliability. Whilst, S did not impact much on wire bond reliability. Instead, it is found that S will hinder the ballpad IMC (intermetallic compound) growth and deteriorate the bond strength. It was noted that contaminations from EMC showed more critical impact on wire bond reliability compared to those from wire and bond pad. It was found that Cl was not easy to attack Au-Al and Cu-Al under HTS. Whilst Cl easily attacked Cu-Al under bHAST compared to that of Au-Al. Several ppm content of Cl could attack Cu-Al.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"The green initiative has driven semiconductor manufacturers to eliminate the use of environmentally unfriendly substances such as antimony oxide, flame retardant and halogenated compounds in their microelectronics packages. Nevertheless, there may be concern that the new chemistries in green package may alter the properties of semiconductor devices. We have evaluated the performance of power transistors encapsulated with green and non-green epoxy mold compound (EMC) via autoclave stress. We have proven that green device indeed possesses superior electrical and physical properties than non-green device. Our research result reveals that device with non-green EMC exhibits relatively higher gate-to-source leakage current (I GSS ) and drain-to-source on-resistance (R DS [on]  ) as compared to device with green EMC. The non-steady electrical characteristic of non-green device is attributed to its higher level content of bromide ions released from flame retardant. Under moist environment, bromide ions form electrolytic solutions and trigger the corrosion process. We found that copper ball bonds in non-green device are extremely susceptible to electrolytic corrosion. The corrosion begins from the ball periphery and gradually extends toward the ball base. The corrosive ions accelerate dissolution of aluminum pad underneath copper ball, leading to separation gap formation between intermetallic and bond pad, thus isolating the pad away from the intermetallic layer. Moreover, the gap size is gradually enlarged when the autoclave stress period is extended, resulting in the rise of R DS[on] over time. In contrast, green device is more impervious to corrosion induced bond damage. As a result, green device demonstrates more stable R DS[on] and lesser leakage current of I GSS even operating under high humidity, pressure, and temperature conditions.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"As a result of increasing gold (Au) price, the use of copper (Cu) bonding wire has gained popularity for mass production. The different properties in hardness, oxidation and electro chemical potential between Au and Cu have a significant impact on the wire bonding process and reliability. This paper focuses on the oxidation and corrosion of Aul AI and Cui AI ball bond for the wire bonding processes and their bond reliability in pressure cooker test (PCT) and halides environment. A design of experiment was conducted to optimize the wire bonding process prior to subjecting the bonded samples to oxidation and corrosion studies. It is noted that a higher ultrasonic energy is necessary for Cu wire bonding. This is likely due to higher energy necessary to break the oxides of copper and aluminum to result in formation of bonds between the wire and the bonding pads. In PCT analysis, the Au ball shear test results remained stable while the Cu ball shear test results improved with soaking. ' CuO blisters are found on the surface of the Cu with corrosion apparent on the circumference of the Cu ball. The corrosion resulted in delamination between Al and Cu and generated undesired interface failure modes. A significant drop in stitch pull strength with large results deviation was observed for Cu wire bonding due to oxidation and stress resulting in cracks of the stitch. In halide environment, an increase in failure rate was observed for Cui AI pad. This is a result of galvanic corrosion due to the very limited intermetallic formation beneath the Cu ball which allowed electrolyte to seep in to initiate galvanic corrosion. This paper provides an insight to the failure mechanisms due to oxidation and corrosion which can weaken the Cui Al bond as compared to Au.\",\n",

The successful transition from gold (Au) to copper (Cu) in wire-bonding introduces corrosion related reliability concerns to wire-bonded devices in integrated circuit (IC) packaging. This report studies the effect of bimetallic contact, Cu wire vs. aluminum (Al) bond pad, on the corrosion failure of Al bond pads when exposed to low ppm levels of chloride (Cl -) contamination. Real time corrosion screening was carried out on simulating Cu/Al micro patterns for time-dependent observation of corrosion progression in 5-20 ppm Cl -solutions at pH 5. Al in Cu/Al bimetallic couple corroded at accelerated rate compared to Al without bimetallic contact. Cathodic hydrogen evolution was found to be the key factor driving this aggressive Al bond pad corrosion under the influence of the peripheral Cu/Al bimetallic contact in acidic chloride solution. Chemically modifying the surface of Cu wires to prevent this H 2 evolution reaction resulted in the inhibition of Al bond pad corrosion.\",\n",

The open circuit potential, E oc , and the corrosion current density, i corr , of Cu and Cu 9 Al 4 with varying amounts of Pd addition were characterized using the potentiodynamic polarization method at 25 \\u2103, 45 \\u2103, and 65 \\u2103. At a given temperature, Pd addition to Cu caused the value of E oc to increase and the value of i corr to decrease due to the higher nobility of Pd. For the Cu 9 Al 4 intermetallics, although Pd addition caused an increase in the value of E oc attributed to the high nobility of Pd, the value of i corr increases with small amounts of Pd addition due to high cathodic activity of Pd. To further evaluate the effect of Pd addition in preventing the corrosion of Cu wire bonds, galvanic current densities, i g , between Cu and Cu 9 Al 4 and their Pd-doped couples were also measured. At 25 \\u2103 and 45 \\u2103, the stabilized value of i g decreases with an increasing amount of Pd addition. At 65 \\u2103, the stabilized value of i g was not lower until 9 wt.% Pd was added. The results of both self-corrosion and galvanic corrosion suggest that the amount of Pd needs to be above a critical value to effectively prevent Cu wire corrosion regardless of the operating temperature\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"A comparison study on the reliability of gold (Au) and copper (Cu) wire bonding is conducted to determine their corrosion and oxidation behavior in different environmental conditions. The corrosion and oxidation behaviors of Au and Cu wire bonding are determined through soaking in sodium chloride (NaCl) solution and high temperature storage (HTS) at 175 \\u00b0C, 200 \\u00b0C and 225 \\u00b0C . Galvanic corrosion is more intense in Cu wire bonding as compared to Au wire bonding in NaCl solution due to the minimal formation of intermetallics in the former. At all three HTS annealing temperatures, the rate of Cu-Al intermetallic formation is found to be three to five times slower than Au-Al intermetallics. The faster intermetallic growth rate and lower activation energy found in this work for both Au/Al and Cu/Al as compared to literature could be due to the thicker Al pad metallization which removed the rate-determining step in previous studies due to deficit in Al material.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Electromigration (EM) reliability and failure analysis of Cu wire and Au wire bonding processes on Al substrates after molding were investigated and compared systematically. According to the resistance as a function of EM time trend, there were four stages during the EM test for wire bonding that can tentatively be referred to as the fluctuating resistance stage, stable resistance stage, rapidly increasing resistance stage and quick failure stage of the sample. When the applied current was 1.8 A on a wire with a diameter of 20 \\u03bcm (at a current density of 5.7 \\u00d7 10 5 A/cm 2 ), the lifetimes of the Cu wire and Au wire bonding processes were 1032 h and 119 h, respectively, according to Weibull analyses. Two kinds of failure modes were observed: wire fracture and first bond fracture. Almost 90% of the failed samples belonged to wire fracture category. After the EM test, the thickness of intermetallic compounds (IMCs) at the anode interface was similar to that at the cathode interface for both the Cu wire and Au wire bonding cases, which means that the normal polarity effect during electromigration did not occur here. However, the thickness of the IMCs at the Au/Al bonding interface was thicker than that at the Cu/ Al interface for both the aged and EM samples. Voids and cracks were observed within the Au wire-bonding interface. It is suspected that the Cu wire bonding process had a slower thermal diffusion and smaller EM flux than those of the Au wire bonding process.

      "    \"abstract\": \"In this study, Cu wire-Al bond pad (CueAl) samples were produced by means of Thermosonic wire bonding technique. Both IMC and ball shear strength were assessed for samples produced with different bonding temperatures, HTS duration and forming gas supply. The experiments were carried out using Taguchi and conventional \\\"one parameter at a time\\\" approaches. For Taguchi method, experiment was managed with L9 orthogonal array for optimizing the wire bonding process. It was observed that the process was optimized with forming gas supply ON, bonding temperature of 400 \\u00b0C and after 1000 h of HTS treatment. This was achieved by a continuous and uniform growth of the IMC across the bonding interface. As for experiment based on \\\"one parameter at a time\\\" approach, a linear proportionality between IMC thickness and ball shear strength was observed. This indicated no void formation at the bonding interface of the sample. In addition, with increased number of run in this experiment, the regression analysis involving interaction of factors was allowed. The measurements' data was found to fit better in the additive model including the interaction of factors. Besides, an additional model based on the fundamental IMC growth behaviour with regards to the bonding temperature and HTS duration was proposed. Regression analysis of this model showed an agreement with measurement data.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"A highly accelerated shear fatigue testing method is presented to test the long-term reliability and reveal the bonded interface of thermosonic CueCu ball bonds. The method is an adaptation to a new industrial fatigue tester (BAMFIT) and can be conducted without an intricate specimen preparation. This method induces mechanical cyclic shear stresses to the Cu nailhead in order to initiate fatigue fracture until lift-off, revealing the actual bonded interface. This study compares the fatigue resistance of Cu wire bonded to coarse and fine grained Cu and Al metallization. The fatigue experiments are accompanied by nano indentation tests, shear tests and finite element analysis. The fatigue results showed the best performance for Cu bonds on coarse grained Cu pads (metallization), followed by those bonded on fine grained Cu while the CueAl nailheads failed at least a decade earlier than CueCu bonds. Annealing the specimens prior to testing resulted in slight increases in the number of loading cycles to failure (N f ) for Cu bonds as well as for CueAl bonds, while the scattering in N f for Cu bonds increased. Nevertheless the calculated endurance limit of the fatigue data decreases with increasing annealing stages, due to a change in the fracture probability curve. With the ability to compare the fatigue behaviour of the bonded interface within minutes, this method is most suitable for rapid qualification at an early stage of development.\",\n",

The as-deposited multi-layers had uniform thicknesses and smooth surface with the roughness of 2.098 nm. X-Ray diffraction analysis indicated that both Ag and Cu layers had deposited with (111) preferred orientation, and the grain size of Ag layer was 29.5 nm. The phase composition of TaN layer was Ta 2 N. For comparison of antioxidation properties, traditional pad structure Ti/Cu/Ag was also fabricated with the same process. Obvious Cu oxidation occurred on the surface of the Ti/Cu/Ag structure after heating at 150 \\u00b0C for 30 min. However, no Cu element was detected on the surface of Ti/Cu/TaN/Ag structure even after heating at 300 \\u00b0C, which indicated that the Ta 2 N layer in Ti/Cu/TaN/Ag structure can prevent the underneath Cu pad from oxidation. 100% Au bondability was achieved on Ti/Cu/TaN/Ag structure under both room temperature and 150 \\u00b0C. The shear fractures mainly occurred in Au bonds, indicating the multi-layers fabricated by magnetron sputtering technology had strong bond interface with Cu pad.\",\n",

Some analytical methods such as SEM, AFM, XRD and XPS were used to characterize the Ag nanofilm metallization and its bondability. It was found that the evaporated Ag metallization has good surface state and samll particle size, which could diffuses readily in the wire bonding process and thus improve the bondablilty. XPS showed the Ag metallization was pure silver without oxidation and sulfuration when stored at the room temperature. And XRD showed the crystal face index of the top surface polycrystalline Ag layer was ( 111), which agree with the principle of minimum surface energy. The bondability and shear strength of the Au ball bump on the Si/Ti-Cu-Ag structure were excellent at room temperature and 150\\u00b0C, better than the oxygen free copper, and meet the JEDEC Standard 22-B116.

      "    \"abstract\": \"Real-time observations of the artificially increased oxide layer during the ultrasonic (US) bonding process were carried out to reveal the self-cleaning mechanisms. After the normal force loading, cracks occurred in the Al 2 O 3 layer at the peripheral region of the wire/substrate interface and were perpendicular to the wire direction. As the US vibration started, the oxides started to detach from the pure metal surface and moved towards the middle of the contact area. With further vibration cycles, these detached oxides were milled from flakes into small particles. Due to three mechanisms including penetration, oxide flow and pushing, the small oxide particles were transported to the peripheral contact region or the outside of the contact area. When a metal splash existed, the flowing out of large amounts of oxides was facilitated. Pre-deformation originates cracks; vibration plays a significant role in detachment, milling, penetration and oxide flow; while the plastic deformation induced material flow is more critical on removing the oxides from the substrate by pushing. The shear tests showed that a 50 nm oxide coating could significantly enhance the Al-glass bonding strength by 2\\u223c3 times.\",\n",

This article reviews the state-of-the-art understanding of the wedge-wedge bonding mechanisms and its four phases 1) Pre-deformation and activation of US vibration, 2) Friction, 3) US softening and 4) Interdiffusion. The aim of this review is to provide fundamental insight into the bonding process and guidance for future research. By surveying existing work in the field, several gaps in current knowledge of the bonding mechanisms can be identified: 1) the relative motion behaviors between wire, substrate and bonding tool are uncertain; 2) the exact local temperature increments at the wire/substrate interface and the role of these temperature increments are not known; 3) the oxides removal mechanism is not well understood, mainly due to the nano-size of oxides and the very short duration of the self-cleaning process; 4) the understanding of the softening mechanism is incomplete and the influence of the softening on the substrate has not been examined; 5) the microwelds formation and breakage rates have been analyzed, neither experimentally nor numerically. Filling these gaps has the potential to further enhance the US wire bonding process.\",\n",

A special focus has been placed on monitoring the temperature rise during ultrasonic vibration. An equivalent method is used to simulate the wire and bond pad, where the large volumes of wire and bond pad are effectively reduced to small computational magnitudes. The history of temperature changes in the wire-bond pad-substrate interfaces influenced by varying bond forces and bond pad sizes is specifically studied. It is shown that the maximum bulk temperature obtained upon completion of ultrasonic vibration is far lower than the melting temperatures of the wire and bond pad materials, indicating that the bulk temperature rise due to ultrasonic vibration is not directly responsible for ultrasonic wire bonding. A large bond pad size usually leads to a lower temperature rise, and when the pad size reaches a certain value, the effect of bond pad size on temperature rise becomes insignificant. A higher bond force results in a marginally higher temperature rise than a lower bond force, which does not necessarily affect the wire bondability.\",\n",

In this article, innovative ribbon materials made of Ag and Ag-4Pd are introduced. The ultrasonic bonding of Ag and Ag-alloy ribbons on direct bonded copper (DBC) substrates metallized with Ni/Pd/Au films was evaluated as replacements for Al and Cu ribbons. A continuous bonding interface with satisfactory pull strength can be obtained from substrates metallized with Pd and Au films due to their similar metallurgical properties and softer surface conditions. The footprint study of bond residuals after pull tests correlated with the failure codes and bond strengths of the modules. The reliability of Ag and Ag-4Pd ribbons with regard to pull strength after high-temperature storage tests (HTSTs) at 150 \\u2022 C for 1000 h was slightly increased, and the bond interface remained unchanged. The results showed that Ag and Ag-alloy ribbons made specifically for power electronics are feasible and can be an attractive alternative to aluminum ribbons.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"The effects of the process parameters of ultrasonic power and normal bonding force on bond formation at ambient temperatures have been investigated with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive x-ray (EDX) analysis. A model was developed based on classical microslip theory 1 to explain the general phenomena observed in the evolution of bond footprints left on the substrate. Modifications to the model are made due to the inherent differences in geometry between ball-bonding and wedge-bonding. Classical microslip theory describes circular contacts undergoing elastic deformation. It is shown in this work that a similar microslip phenomenon occurs for elliptical wireto-flat contacts with plastically deformed wire. It is shown that relative motion exists at the bonding interface as peripheral microslip at lower powers, transitioning into gross sliding at higher powers. With increased normal bonding forces, the transition point into gross sliding occurs at higher ultrasonic bonding powers. These results indicate that the bonding mechanisms in aluminum wire wedge-bonding are very similar to those of gold ball-bonding, both on copper substrate. In ultrasonic wedge-bonding onto copper substrates, the ultrasonic energy is essential in forming bonding by creating relative interfacial motion, which removes the surface oxides.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Ultrasonic wire bonding is a process to form electrical connections in electronics well established industry. Typically, a clamping tool is pressed on the wire and forced to vibrate at relative high frequency 40 to 100 kHz. The ultrasonic vibration is transmitted through the wire into the interface between wire and substrate. Due to frictional processes, contamination like oxide layers are removed from the contact zone, the surface roughness is reduced, and with increasing bond duration an metallic connection of wire and substrate is established. It is known that the amount of ultrasonic energy over time directly influences the strength and reliability of the bond connection, but the determination of optimum bond parameters is still a challenging experimental task. For this, in the past different model approaches have been presented, to calculate the bond quality by simulation. Measuring the friction between wire and substrate to validate these models is a challenging task at ultrasonic bonding frequency. Therefore a versatile test rig for bonding experiments at frequencies lower than 1 kHz is setup to get detailed insight into the different phases of the connection process. It includes a piezoelectric force sensor for the measurement of the three-dimensional process forces, an electrodynamic shaker for the vibration excitation and a conventional tension-compression testing machine to apply the bond normal force. Using this test rig, it is possible to observe the different phases of bond formation in detail, validate and enhance existing models and finally optimize bond parameters for different processes.\",\n",

A special focus has been placed on how the important wire bonding parameters, such as bond force and power, affect the contact pressure along the wire-bond pad interface. It is shown that the contact interface had a long elliptical shape, and the maximum contact pressure occurred always at the periphery of the contact interface, which is consistent in the current 2-D and 3-D finite element analyses. The normalised real contact area as well as the maximum frictional energy intensity varied in a similar manner to the contact pressure, with the maximum values occurring at the periphery of contact interface, where weld is preferentially formed in practical wire bonding. A higher bond force does not result in a higher contact pressure, or higher frictional energy intensity, suggesting that a high bond force is not directly correlated to better wire bondability.\",\n",

Introduction Ultrasonic (US) wire bonding, which applies a normal force and US vibration to join wire and substrate, is a widely used interconnection technique in electronic packaging industry since its invention in the 1960s [1]. Nowadays, about one million bonds per second in integrated circuits (ICs), transistors, power devices and other special applications are made globally by this technique [2]. Despite its wide and long term applications, the underlying mechanisms are still not well understood, due to the short processing time (tens of milliseconds), the high vibration frequency (60 150 kHz), the enclosed interface and the highly dynamic changes. Among these mechanisms, the knowledge on the changes of microwelds at the wire/substrate interface during the bonding process, including the formation, deformation and breakage of microwelds , is particularly limited. Since bonds are constituted by numerous microwelds, the bonding quality is determined by the microweld changes, specifically by the competition between the formation, deformation and breakage. The same goes for the other US metal joining processes, including US wire welding, US metal welding and US metal consolidation, in which the microwelds determine the joining quality.\",\n",

According to [2,3], the bonding process can be divided into four phases namely: pre deformation and activation of vibration, friction, US softening and interdiffusion. The last three phases overlap with each other. The pre deformation of the wire caused by the normal force loading creates an elliptic contact between the wire and the substrate and cracks of the oxide layer [4]. After US activation, the wire starts to slide on the substrate and relative motions between the wire and the substrate are generated [5,6]. During this friction phase, the oxides within the contact interface are detached from the metal surface and transported to the peripheral or outside contact region [4,7]. The US vibration also brings a softening effect which causes the bulk deformation of the wire and the deformation of the surface asperities [8 10]. This bulk deformation also causes a relative motion between wire and substrate. The deformation of asperities brings more local areas closer. As local oxides are removed 1\",\n",

Fig. 1 (a) and (b) show the bonding status in the beginning and ending stage, respectively. The substrate can be considered to be fixed since its vibration amplitude is negligible.

It can be seen that from zero strain to 0.186 (0.174 for Cu), no defect existed and the nano cube was only elastically deformed. Along with the increase of the strain, the shear stress linearly increased. After the ultimate point, the transition from elastic deformation to plastic deformation occurred. The defects of the crystal caused a sudden drop of the shear stress. At 0.25 strain, most of the lattice structure within the cube was destroyed. These results are in agreement with the literature [44]. It can be seen that the equivalent area Ae is not the real bonded area.

Large amounts of atoms moved along with the deformation of the microweld to fill the valley between the asperities of the substrate.

As the horizontal displacement continued, the microweld area decreased until the two surfaces were separated, which are shown in Fig. 7 (f) (g). During the separation, many atoms from the wire part were left on the substrate part. For actual bonding, this makes the experimental analysis of microwelds much more difficult. The whole process described in this section revealed four facts. First, an asperity that comes from a broken microweld can form a new microweld even at its original position, as long as it is able to get into contact with the surface atoms of the bonding partner. Second, the shape of the asperities or the surface topographies can be greatly changed under the repeated horizontal movement, especially for large asperities. Third, large amounts of dislocations are formed during the repeated formation , deformation and breakage of microwelds. Finally, the formation and breakage of microwelds are at the atomic level and occur within an extremely short time.\",\n",

After reaching its first peak value around 94 ps, the shear stress decreased as both the two microwelds were largely deformed and the total microweld area decreased. When both microwelds were broken, the stress decreased to zero. The formation of the new microweld (Fig. 6 (e)) resulted into the second peak of the stress. As this microweld was broken, no shear stress existed. During the leftwards movement, repeated microweld formation and breakage occurred and caused the fluctuation of the stress. The peak value of the shear stress, however, stayed similar around 0.2 GPa. The peak shear stress significantly increased during the second rightwards movement when the whole surfaces joined together. The change of the equivalent bonded area in Fig. 8 (b) is consistent with the change of the shear stress. In general, the joining of the two surfaces was greatly enhanced via the horizontal movement. The maximal microweld area increased from 228 2 in the beginning to 308 2 in the end.\",\n",

This led to the large shear stress during the second vibration cycle and caused the deformation of the substrate Newton layer, as marked in Fig. 11 (b). The increase of the shear stress and the equivalent area is reflected in Fig. 12 (a) and (b), respectively. From Fig. 11 (b), it can also be seen that the horizontal movement greatly changed the surface topography of the wire part which became flat from the front view. During the 4th vibration cycle, the whole wire surface came into contact with the substrate surface (from the front view), as marked in Fig 11(c).

This indicates that the constant horizontal movement played a significant role in changing the surface topographies.

Comparably, an apparent increment of the shear stress and bonded area can be found for Al Al in Section 3.2. In the last vibration cycle, due to the large stress induced distortion of the wire part, the bonded area of Al Al was smaller than that of Cu Cu. This shows that the stiffness of the material has a negative effect on the microweld growth. To obtain a similar microweld area, more vibration cycles would be needed.

No significant change of the topographies was observed in (a). The misalignment of the asperities insignificantly influenced the microweld changes. Compared to ST1 DP1, the significant role of the larger asperities is demonstrated. The formation, deformation and breakage of the larger microweld constituted by the larger asperities greatly changed the topographies of both surfaces. This is further validated by the small changes in (b). When there were only three small asperities, the topographies after four vibration cycles were nearly the same as those before vibration. In the case of ST4 where the wire and pad surfaces were much closer than those in the other cases, the final topographies were totally changed.

The normal force produces the normal stress on the asperities and transfers the US energy to the asperities [6]. The US power provides the energy for the softening effect and generates vibration. In other words, US power significantly influences the approaching distance and vibration. Thus, in a certain range, a larger normal force and a higher US power could enhance the bonding quality.\",\n",

From (a) to (b), large amounts of atoms from the wire Newton layer were left on the substrate surface and filled up many valleys. The connected area greatly decreased and the few small asperities of the substrate surface changed to two large asperities. As shown in (c), the wire part was disconnected with the substrate part.

The results show that a large vibration amplitude makes the microweld change faster while a large vibration amplitude does not necessarily increase the shear stress and the microweld area. In actual bonding process, a higher US power might cause more substantial deformation of asperities. However, it could also break the existing microwelds when the shear stress increases [7]. As a result, a middle level of US power is usually preferred [6,48].\",\n",

To study the scaling effect on the simulation results, each of the three dimensions of ST1 was magnified by three times. The magnified model has 1.05 million atoms. Despite the magnification, the dimensions of the asperities are still only comparable to the uncommonly used surface roughness [7,9]. Therefore, the results in this work are only used to deduce the microweld and surface topography changes in reality. Fig. 34.

With further displacement to the moment of Fig. 33 (d), the space between the two asperities of the wire part was fulfilled with the atoms from the substrate.

Thus, it is assumed that in wire bonding processes, the normal force (vertical movement) and vibration cause microweld formation, deformation and breakage; in different locations of the interface, these changes are different; the topographies are greatly changed in all locations of the interface. As the rightwards movement starts, the shear stress soon reached its maximal value (0.295 GPa), as shown in Fig. 34 (a). Due to the gripping of the substrate atoms, the shear stress did not increase in the following process, which is different from that of the unscaled model in Fig. 8.

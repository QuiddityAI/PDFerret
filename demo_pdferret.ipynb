In this study, transmission electron microscopy is used to examine ultrasonic bonding of aluminum wire to various metal substrates. A special technique for preparing cross-section TEM specimens is described which involves embedding the samples in epoxy, dimpling, and electropolishing. The materials systems examined are A1 wire bonded to A1 foil, and A1 wire bonded to foil onto which copper or gold was evaporated. of the bond interface in the TEM reveals that in some areas, the surface oxides and contaminants were dispersed, allowing the bare metals to contact, whereas in other nearby areas, the bond interface is filled with debris. The debris could be oxides, surface contaminants or sheared metal particles. It also appears that the debris is dispersed to low-lying regions between asperities. In studies of the Al/Au/Al and Al/Cu/Al interfaces, microchemical analysis showed no evidence for diffusion or melting along the interface. Therefore, it is concluded that ultrasonic wire bonding does not involve significant heating along the bonding interface. However, it is shown that dynamic annealing of aluminum wire can occur during bonding. compared with the previously proposed theories on the mechanism of bonding in ultrasonic welding.The experimental results are\",\n",

The effects of the EFO and bonding parameters on the characteristics of the FAB as well as the bonded strength were investigated using scanning electron microscopy. The results showed that, for a constant EFO time, the FAB of the Ag-10Au-3.6Pd alloy bonding wire transitioned from a pointed defined ball to an oval one, then to a perfectly shaped one, and finally to a golf ball with an increase in the EFO current. On the other hand, when the EFO current was constant and the EFO time was increased, the FAB changed from a small ball to a perfect one, then to a large one, and finally to a golf ball. The FAB exhibited the optimal geometry at an EFO current of 0.030 A and EFO time of 0.8 ms. Further, in the case of the Ag-10Au-3.6Pd alloy bonding wire, for an EFO current of 0.030 A, the FAB diameter exhibited a nonlinear relationship with the EFO time, which could be expressed by a quadratic function. Finally, the bonded strength decreased when the bonding power and force were excessively high, causing the ball bond to overflow. This led to the formation of neck cracks and decrease in the bonded strength. On the other hand, the bonded strength was insufficiently when the bonding power and force were small. The bonded strength was of the desired level when the bonding power and force were 70 mW and 0.60 N (for the ball bonded) and 95 mW and 0.85 N (for the wedge bonded), respectively.\",\n",

The cleaning methods of different process parameters were studied, and the appropriate process parameters were found. Plasma cleaning was performed on different substrates and chips and compared with those before plasma cleaning. The influence of plasma cleaning on bond contact quality has been examined by pull force measurements, which is an established test method in semiconductor packaging industry for evaluating the quality of wire bonds. From the experimental data, it is observed that the plasma cleaning with proper parameter tuning can improve the contact angle characteristics and the reliability of wire bonding, and the wire bonding strength after plasma cleaning meets microwave hybrid integrated circuit requirements.

      "    \"abstract\": \"As a result of increasing gold (Au) price, the use of copper (Cu) bonding wire has gained popularity for mass production. The different properties in hardness, oxidation and electro chemical potential between Au and Cu have a significant impact on the wire bonding process and reliability. This paper focuses on the oxidation and corrosion of Aul AI and Cui AI ball bond for the wire bonding processes and their bond reliability in pressure cooker test (PCT) and halides environment. A design of experiment was conducted to optimize the wire bonding process prior to subjecting the bonded samples to oxidation and corrosion studies. It is noted that a higher ultrasonic energy is necessary for Cu wire bonding. This is likely due to higher energy necessary to break the oxides of copper and aluminum to result in formation of bonds between the wire and the bonding pads. In PCT analysis, the Au ball shear test results remained stable while the Cu ball shear test results improved with soaking. ' CuO blisters are found on the surface of the Cu with corrosion apparent on the circumference of the Cu ball. The corrosion resulted in delamination between Al and Cu and generated undesired interface failure modes. A significant drop in stitch pull strength with large results deviation was observed for Cu wire bonding due to oxidation and stress resulting in cracks of the stitch. In halide environment, an increase in failure rate was observed for Cui AI pad. This is a result of galvanic corrosion due to the very limited intermetallic formation beneath the Cu ball which allowed electrolyte to seep in to initiate galvanic corrosion. This paper provides an insight to the failure mechanisms due to oxidation and corrosion which can weaken the Cui Al bond as compared to Au.\",\n",

Galvanic corrosion is more intense in Cu wire bonding as compared to Au wire bonding in NaCl solution due to the minimal formation of intermetallics in the former.

      "    \"abstract\": \"Electromigration (EM) reliability and failure analysis of Cu wire and Au wire bonding processes on Al substrates after molding were investigated and compared systematically. According to the resistance as a function of EM time trend, there were four stages during the EM test for wire bonding that can tentatively be referred to as the fluctuating resistance stage, stable resistance stage, rapidly increasing resistance stage and quick failure stage of the sample. When the applied current was 1.8 A on a wire with a diameter of 20 \\u03bcm (at a current density of 5.7 \\u00d7 10 5 A/cm 2 ), the lifetimes of the Cu wire and Au wire bonding processes were 1032 h and 119 h, respectively, according to Weibull analyses. Two kinds of failure modes were observed: wire fracture and first bond fracture. Almost 90% of the failed samples belonged to wire fracture category. After the EM test, the thickness of intermetallic compounds (IMCs) at the anode interface was similar to that at the cathode interface for both the Cu wire and Au wire bonding cases, which means that the normal polarity effect during electromigration did not occur here. However, the thickness of the IMCs at the Au/Al bonding interface was thicker than that at the Cu/ Al interface for both the aged and EM samples. Voids and cracks were observed within the Au wire-bonding interface. It is suspected that the Cu wire bonding process had a slower thermal diffusion and smaller EM flux than those of the Au wire bonding process. Due to a decrease in vacancy flux within the Cu wire bonding region, the cracks were also suppressed, which greatly extended the lifetime of the Cu wire bonds.\",\n",

The different properties in hardness, oxidation and electro chemical potential between Au and Cu have a significant impact on the wire bonding process and reliability. This paper focuses on the oxidation and corrosion of Aul AI and Cui AI ball bond for the wire bonding processes and their bond reliability in pressure cooker test (PCT) and halides environment. A design of experiment was conducted to optimize the wire bonding process prior to subjecting the bonded samples to oxidation and corrosion studies. It is noted that a higher ultrasonic energy is necessary for Cu wire bonding. This is likely due to higher energy necessary to break the oxides of copper and aluminum to result in formation of bonds between the wire and the bonding pads. In PCT analysis, the Au ball shear test results remained stable while the Cu ball shear test results improved with soaking. ' CuO blisters are found on the surface of the Cu with corrosion apparent on the circumference of the Cu ball. The corrosion resulted in delamination between Al and Cu and generated undesired interface failure modes. A significant drop in stitch pull strength with large results deviation was observed for Cu wire bonding due to oxidation and stress resulting in cracks of the stitch. In halide environment, an increase in failure rate was observed for Cui AI pad. This is a result of galvanic corrosion due to the very limited intermetallic formation beneath the Cu ball which allowed electrolyte to seep in to initiate galvanic corrosion. This paper provides an insight to the failure mechanisms due to oxidation and corrosion which can weaken the Cui Al bond as compared to Au.\",\n",

The successful transition from gold (Au) to copper (Cu) in wire-bonding introduces corrosion related reliability concerns to wire-bonded devices in integrated circuit (IC) packaging. This report studies the effect of bimetallic contact, Cu wire vs. aluminum (Al) bond pad, on the corrosion failure of Al bond pads when exposed to low ppm levels of chloride (Cl -) contamination. Real time corrosion screening was carried out on simulating Cu/Al micro patterns for time-dependent observation of corrosion progression in 5-20 ppm Cl -solutions at pH 5. Al in Cu/Al bimetallic couple corroded at accelerated rate compared to Al without bimetallic contact. Cathodic hydrogen evolution was found to be the key factor driving this aggressive Al bond pad corrosion under the influence of the peripheral Cu/Al bimetallic contact in acidic chloride solution. Chemically modifying the surface of Cu wires to prevent this H 2 evolution reaction resulted in the inhibition of Al bond pad corrosion.\",\n",

Galvanic corrosion is more intense in Cu wire bonding as compared to Au wire bonding in NaCl solution due to the minimal formation of intermetallics in the former. At all three HTS annealing temperatures, the rate of Cu-Al intermetallic formation is found to be three to five times slower than Au-Al intermetallics. The faster intermetallic growth rate and lower activation energy found in this work for both Au/Al and Cu/Al as compared to literature could be due to the thicker Al pad metallization which removed the rate-determining step in previous studies due to deficit in Al material.\",\n",

The flash-Au film increases the resistance to chlorination and sulfidation of the silver (Ag) alloy wire, which is susceptible to deterioration in a chlorine-and sulfur-rich environment. In the chlorination test, the mechanical properties of the AAPA wire were better than those of the APA wire. Chloride ions corrode the wire along grain boundaries, resulting in a change from ductile fracture to brittle fracture in the tensile test. Chloride ions preferentially corroded the aluminum (Al) pad, greatly decreasing the reliability of the ball bond. The wedge bond did not fail due to the use of Au pad. In the sulfidation test, the average diameter of the wire increased with increasing sulfidation time. After sulfidation, the electrical conductivity decreased due to the thickening of Ag 2 S, whose resistance is high, and a decrease in the effective channel of the electric current. In addition, the formation of Ag 2 S caused a consumption of Ag atoms in the Ag wire, and thus formed voids at the interface between the sulfide layer and the Ag wire. The fracture of the sulfided ball bond was located in the heat-affected zone after the tensile test. The results show that the AAPA wire has better resistance in chlorination and sulfidation environment.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Manufacturing of electronic assemblies using printed circuit boards (PCBs) with electroless nickel/immersion gold (ENIG) surface finishes requires front-end PCB evaluation that will guarantee that good quality product enters the assembly line. The most common is an IPC-4552 mandated plating thicknesses verification of 3-6\\u00b5m and a minimum of 0.05\\u00b5m for nickel and gold, respectively. Coupled with visual examination, this verification method suffices for general PCB acceptance but may not be robust enough in cases where ENIG plating in PCBs is compromised. That poses challenges in the manufacturing environment, where resulting latent defects are detected in downstream processes but not at upfront incoming inspection. Manifestation of such latent anomaly was observed in the form of ENIG pad discoloration with variations from yellow, red or grey discolored surfaces to a more pronounced plating degradation, such as corrosive pitting. The launched failure analysis involved evaluation of manufacturing processes suspected to contribute to the cause of the condition. Effects of thermal processes, cleaning methods, soldering, parylene deposition and factory cleanliness were examined thoroughly. Concurrently, metallurgical analysis of ENIG pads was performed, where samples were subjected to scanning electron microscopic/energy dispersive xray spectroscopic (SEM/EDX) cross section analysis, Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) and gold (Au) and electroless nickel (Ni) surface examination. The resulting analysis revealed a highly porous electroless nickel coating with deep crevasses and fissures penetrating down to the base copper (Cu) layer. These open nickel boundaries were attributed to the corrosive environment within ENIG plating, which resulted in the pad surface discoloration. The root cause of ENIG pad discoloration and pitting was traced back to poor ENIG line process controls. Subsequent introduction of a nickel controller into the ENIG line were the implemented countermeasures. To mitigate the effects of discoloration at the electronic assembly level, a tinning process was implemented to prevent nickel plating oxidation and to ensure that good wettability for reliable solder joints was maintained.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"The green initiative has driven semiconductor manufacturers to eliminate the use of environmentally unfriendly substances such as antimony oxide, flame retardant and halogenated compounds in their microelectronics packages. Nevertheless, there may be concern that the new chemistries in green package may alter the properties of semiconductor devices. We have evaluated the performance of power transistors encapsulated with green and non-green epoxy mold compound (EMC) via autoclave stress. We have proven that green device indeed possesses superior electrical and physical properties than non-green device. Our research result reveals that device with non-green EMC exhibits relatively higher gate-to-source leakage current (I GSS ) and drain-to-source on-resistance (R DS [on]  ) as compared to device with green EMC. The non-steady electrical characteristic of non-green device is attributed to its higher level content of bromide ions released from flame retardant. Under moist environment, bromide ions form electrolytic solutions and trigger the corrosion process. We found that copper ball bonds in non-green device are extremely susceptible to electrolytic corrosion. The corrosion begins from the ball periphery and gradually extends toward the ball base. The corrosive ions accelerate dissolution of aluminum pad underneath copper ball, leading to separation gap formation between intermetallic and bond pad, thus isolating the pad away from the intermetallic layer. Moreover, the gap size is gradually enlarged when the autoclave stress period is extended, resulting in the rise of R DS[on] over time. In contrast, green device is more impervious to corrosion induced bond damage. As a result, green device demonstrates more stable R DS[on] and lesser leakage current of I GSS even operating under high humidity, pressure, and temperature conditions.\",\n",

A design of experiment was conducted to optimize the wire bonding process prior to subjecting the bonded samples to oxidation and corrosion studies. It is noted that a higher ultrasonic energy is necessary for Cu wire bonding. This is likely due to higher energy necessary to break the oxides of copper and aluminum to result in formation of bonds between the wire and the bonding pads. In PCT analysis, the Au ball shear test results remained stable while the Cu ball shear test results improved with soaking. ' CuO blisters are found on the surface of the Cu with corrosion apparent on the circumference of the Cu ball. The corrosion resulted in delamination between Al and Cu and generated undesired interface failure modes. A significant drop in stitch pull strength with large results deviation was observed for Cu wire bonding due to oxidation and stress resulting in cracks of the stitch. In halide environment, an increase in failure rate was observed for Cui AI pad. This is a result of galvanic corrosion due to the very limited intermetallic formation beneath the Cu ball which allowed electrolyte to seep in to initiate galvanic corrosion. This paper provides an insight to the failure mechanisms due to oxidation and corrosion which can weaken the Cui Al bond as compared to Au.\",\n",

The successful transition from gold (Au) to copper (Cu) in wire-bonding introduces corrosion related reliability concerns to wire-bonded devices in integrated circuit (IC) packaging. This report studies the effect of bimetallic contact, Cu wire vs. aluminum (Al) bond pad, on the corrosion failure of Al bond pads when exposed to low ppm levels of chloride (Cl -) contamination. Real time corrosion screening was carried out on simulating Cu/Al micro patterns for time-dependent observation of corrosion progression in 5-20 ppm Cl -solutions at pH 5. Al in Cu/Al bimetallic couple corroded at accelerated rate compared to Al without bimetallic contact. Cathodic hydrogen evolution was found to be the key factor driving this aggressive Al bond pad corrosion under the influence of the peripheral Cu/Al bimetallic contact in acidic chloride solution. Chemically modifying the surface of Cu wires to prevent this H 2 evolution reaction resulted in the inhibition of Al bond pad corrosion.\",\n",

The open circuit potential, E oc , and the corrosion current density, i corr , of Cu and Cu 9 Al 4 with varying amounts of Pd addition were characterized using the potentiodynamic polarization method at 25 \\u2103, 45 \\u2103, and 65 \\u2103. At a given temperature, Pd addition to Cu caused the value of E oc to increase and the value of i corr to decrease due to the higher nobility of Pd. For the Cu 9 Al 4 intermetallics, although Pd addition caused an increase in the value of E oc attributed to the high nobility of Pd, the value of i corr increases with small amounts of Pd addition due to high cathodic activity of Pd. To further evaluate the effect of Pd addition in preventing the corrosion of Cu wire bonds, galvanic current densities, i g , between Cu and Cu 9 Al 4 and their Pd-doped couples were also measured. At 25 \\u2103 and 45 \\u2103, the stabilized value of i g decreases with an increasing amount of Pd addition. At 65 \\u2103, the stabilized value of i g was not lower until 9 wt.% Pd was added. The results of both self-corrosion and galvanic corrosion suggest that the amount of Pd needs to be above a critical value to effectively prevent Cu wire corrosion regardless of the operating temperature\",\n",

The corrosion and oxidation behaviors of Au and Cu wire bonding are determined through soaking in sodium chloride (NaCl) solution and high temperature storage (HTS) at 175 \\u00b0C, 200 \\u00b0C and 225 \\u00b0C . Galvanic corrosion is more intense in Cu wire bonding as compared to Au wire bonding in NaCl solution due to the minimal formation of intermetallics in the former. At all three HTS annealing temperatures, the rate of Cu-Al intermetallic formation is found to be three to five times slower than Au-Al intermetallics. The faster intermetallic growth rate and lower activation energy found in this work for both Au/Al and Cu/Al as compared to literature could be due to the thicker Al pad metallization which removed the rate-determining step in previous studies due to deficit in Al material.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Electromigration (EM) reliability and failure analysis of Cu wire and Au wire bonding processes on Al substrates after molding were investigated and compared systematically. According to the resistance as a function of EM time trend, there were four stages during the EM test for wire bonding that can tentatively be referred to as the fluctuating resistance stage, stable resistance stage, rapidly increasing resistance stage and quick failure stage of the sample. When the applied current was 1.8 A on a wire with a diameter of 20 \\u03bcm (at a current density of 5.7 \\u00d7 10 5 A/cm 2 ), the lifetimes of the Cu wire and Au wire bonding processes were 1032 h and 119 h, respectively, according to Weibull analyses. Two kinds of failure modes were observed: wire fracture and first bond fracture. Almost 90% of the failed samples belonged to wire fracture category. After the EM test, the thickness of intermetallic compounds (IMCs) at the anode interface was similar to that at the cathode interface for both the Cu wire and Au wire bonding cases, which means that the normal polarity effect during electromigration did not occur here. However, the thickness of the IMCs at the Au/Al bonding interface was thicker than that at the Cu/ Al interface for both the aged and EM samples. Voids and cracks were observed within the Au wire-bonding interface. It is suspected that the Cu wire bonding process had a slower thermal diffusion and smaller EM flux than those of the Au wire bonding process. Due to a decrease in vacancy flux within the Cu wire bonding region, the cracks were also suppressed, which greatly extended the lifetime of the Cu wire bonds.\",\n",

As for experiment based on \\\"one parameter at a time\\\" approach, a linear proportionality between IMC thickness and ball shear strength was observed. This indicated no void formation at the bonding interface of the sample. In addition, with increased number of run in this experiment, the regression analysis involving interaction of factors was allowed.

The method is an adaptation to a new industrial fatigue tester (BAMFIT) and can be conducted without an intricate specimen preparation. This method induces mechanical cyclic shear stresses to the Cu nailhead in order to initiate fatigue fracture until lift-off, revealing the actual bonded interface. This study compares the fatigue resistance of Cu wire bonded to coarse and fine grained Cu and Al metallization. The fatigue experiments are accompanied by nano indentation tests, shear tests and finite element analysis. The fatigue results showed the best performance for Cu bonds on coarse grained Cu pads (metallization), followed by those bonded on fine grained Cu while the CueAl nailheads failed at least a decade earlier than CueCu bonds. Annealing the specimens prior to testing resulted in slight increases in the number of loading cycles to failure (N f ) for Cu bonds as well as for CueAl bonds, while the scattering in N f for Cu bonds increased. Nevertheless the calculated endurance limit of the fatigue data decreases with increasing annealing stages, due to a change in the fracture probability curve. With the ability to compare the fatigue behaviour of the bonded interface within minutes, this method is most suitable for rapid qualification at an early stage of development.\",\n",

After the normal force loading, cracks occurred in the Al 2 O 3 layer at the peripheral region of the wire/substrate interface and were perpendicular to the wire direction. As the US vibration started, the oxides started to detach from the pure metal surface and moved towards the middle of the contact area. With further vibration cycles, these detached oxides were milled from flakes into small particles. Due to three mechanisms including penetration, oxide flow and pushing, the small oxide particles were transported to the peripheral contact region or the outside of the contact area. When a metal splash existed, the flowing out of large amounts of oxides was facilitated. Pre-deformation originates cracks; vibration plays a significant role in detachment, milling, penetration and oxide flow; while the plastic deformation induced material flow is more critical on removing the oxides from the substrate by pushing. The shear tests showed that a 50 nm oxide coating could significantly enhance the Al-glass bonding strength by 2\\u223c3 times.\",\n",

A special focus has been placed on monitoring the temperature rise during ultrasonic vibration. An equivalent method is used to simulate the wire and bond pad, where the large volumes of wire and bond pad are effectively reduced to small computational magnitudes. The history of temperature changes in the wire-bond pad-substrate interfaces influenced by varying bond forces and bond pad sizes is specifically studied. It is shown that the maximum bulk temperature obtained upon completion of ultrasonic vibration is far lower than the melting temperatures of the wire and bond pad materials, indicating that the bulk temperature rise due to ultrasonic vibration is not directly responsible for ultrasonic wire bonding. A large bond pad size usually leads to a lower temperature rise, and when the pad size reaches a certain value, the effect of bond pad size on temperature rise becomes insignificant. A higher bond force results in a marginally higher temperature rise than a lower bond force, which does not necessarily affect the wire bondability.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"With the development of automotive power electronics and high-power integrated circuits, ribbon bonding is currently in the spotlight for its superior properties to those of traditional heavy wire bonding. In this article, innovative ribbon materials made of Ag and Ag-4Pd are introduced. The ultrasonic bonding of Ag and Ag-alloy ribbons on direct bonded copper (DBC) substrates metallized with Ni/Pd/Au films was evaluated as replacements for Al and Cu ribbons. A continuous bonding interface with satisfactory pull strength can be obtained from substrates metallized with Pd and Au films due to their similar metallurgical properties and softer surface conditions. The footprint study of bond residuals after pull tests correlated with the failure codes and bond strengths of the modules. The reliability of Ag and Ag-4Pd ribbons with regard to pull strength after high-temperature storage tests (HTSTs) at 150 \\u2022 C for 1000 h was slightly increased, and the bond interface remained unchanged. The results showed that Ag and Ag-alloy ribbons made specifically for power electronics are feasible and can be an attractive alternative to aluminum ribbons.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"The effects of the process parameters of ultrasonic power and normal bonding force on bond formation at ambient temperatures have been investigated with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive x-ray (EDX) analysis. A model was developed based on classical microslip theory 1 to explain the general phenomena observed in the evolution of bond footprints left on the substrate. Modifications to the model are made due to the inherent differences in geometry between ball-bonding and wedge-bonding. Classical microslip theory describes circular contacts undergoing elastic deformation. It is shown in this work that a similar microslip phenomenon occurs for elliptical wireto-flat contacts with plastically deformed wire. It is shown that relative motion exists at the bonding interface as peripheral microslip at lower powers, transitioning into gross sliding at higher powers. With increased normal bonding forces, the transition point into gross sliding occurs at higher ultrasonic bonding powers. These results indicate that the bonding mechanisms in aluminum wire wedge-bonding are very similar to those of gold ball-bonding, both on copper substrate. In ultrasonic wedge-bonding onto copper substrates, the ultrasonic energy is essential in forming bonding by creating relative interfacial motion, which removes the surface oxides.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Ultrasonic wire bonding is a process to form electrical connections in electronics well established industry. Typically, a clamping tool is pressed on the wire and forced to vibrate at relative high frequency 40 to 100 kHz. The ultrasonic vibration is transmitted through the wire into the interface between wire and substrate. Due to frictional processes, contamination like oxide layers are removed from the contact zone, the surface roughness is reduced, and with increasing bond duration an metallic connection of wire and substrate is established. It is known that the amount of ultrasonic energy over time directly influences the strength and reliability of the bond connection, but the determination of optimum bond parameters is still a challenging experimental task. For this, in the past different model approaches have been presented, to calculate the bond quality by simulation. Measuring the friction between wire and substrate to validate these models is a challenging task at ultrasonic bonding frequency. Therefore a versatile test rig for bonding experiments at frequencies lower than 1 kHz is setup to get detailed insight into the different phases of the connection process. It includes a piezoelectric force sensor for the measurement of the three-dimensional process forces, an electrodynamic shaker for the vibration excitation and a conventional tension-compression testing machine to apply the bond normal force. Using this test rig, it is possible to observe the different phases of bond formation in detail, validate and enhance existing models and finally optimize bond parameters for different processes.\",\n",

A special focus has been placed on how the important wire bonding parameters, such as bond force and power, affect the contact pressure along the wire-bond pad interface. It is shown that the contact interface had a long elliptical shape, and the maximum contact pressure occurred always at the periphery of the contact interface, which is consistent in the current 2-D and 3-D finite element analyses. The normalised real contact area as well as the maximum frictional energy intensity varied in a similar manner to the contact pressure, with the maximum values occurring at the periphery of contact interface, where weld is preferentially formed in practical wire bonding. A higher bond force does not result in a higher contact pressure, or higher frictional energy intensity, suggesting that a high bond force is not directly correlated to better wire bondability.\",\n",
